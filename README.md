Hi, this is a project made by me called FoodBook, It is an app to avoid long queues at the food courts of shopping malls. Order at your ease from the table and get a timer to notify when the food is prepared.
Has the following key features:
1. Firebase based Login and Signup
2. Image slider for restaurant promotions
3. Recycler View for Restaurant name, cuisine, time to deliver, cost to deliver etc.
4. A menu for each restaurant, can be accessed when you click on the restaurant recycler view
5. In the Cart section, dynamic calculation of prices when you increment or decrement the item quantities
6. Razorpay Payment Gateway integrated for payments
7. Recently bought tab also contains a search bar
8. Profile section
